# 🌑 Zhyniria: The Shadows of the Abyss

**A Dark Text Adventure Through an Ancient Tower**

> *"Millions of years ago, an enormous tower appeared... Now, you must uncover its secrets or be consumed by the darkness within."*

---

## 📖 Story

In the world of Zhyniria, the Tower of Dreams stands as a colossal monument that defies time and logic. Built millennia ago by a forgotten civilization, this tower was designed to contain and channel arcane energy. However, over the centuries, the barrier between dreams and nightmares began to weaken.

Now, dark nightmares have corrupted the tower from within, transforming it into a living, ever-changing dungeon. **You are a brave soul who dares to enter**, but beware—the tower is not just a physical place; it is a reflection of the soul and mind of those who explore it.

Will you survive the shadows? Or will you become another lost soul in the abyss?
